# TypeScript Roadmap

TypeScript learning roadmap into more detailed with micro-level bullet points:

## 1. **JavaScript Fundamentals:**
   - Variables and Scopes
   - Data Types (Numbers, Strings, Booleans, Objects, Arrays, Functions)
   - Control Structures (if-else, switch, loops)
   - ES6+ Features (Arrow Functions, Template Literals, Destructuring, Spread Operator)

## 2. **TypeScript Introduction:**
   - Understanding TypeScript's Role and Advantages
   - Installing TypeScript (npm, yarn) and Setting up tsconfig.json
   - Compiling TypeScript to JavaScript

## 3. **Basic Types:**
   - number, string, boolean
   - arrays, tuples, enums
   - any, void, null, undefined

## 4. **Type Annotations and Inference:**
   - Explicit Type Annotations
   - Type Inference by TypeScript
   - Working with Primitive and Complex Types

## 5. **Functions and Object Types:**
   - Typing Function Parameters and Return Values
   - Optional and Default Parameters
   - Function Overloads
   - Object Types and Type Aliases

## 6. **Interfaces:**
   - Defining and Implementing Interfaces
   - Optional Properties and Readonly Properties
   - Extending Interfaces
   - Implementing Multiple Interfaces

## 7. **Classes and OOP:**
   - Creating Classes and Constructors
   - Class Properties (Public, Private, Protected)
   - Class Methods and Access Modifiers
   - Inheritance and Abstract Classes

## 8. **Advanced Types:**
   - Union and Intersection Types
   - Conditional Types
   - Type Guards and Type Predicates
   - Mapped Types and Index Signatures
   - Generics and Generic Constraints

## 9. **Modules and Namespaces:**
   - Organizing Code with Modules
   - Importing and Exporting Modules
   - Working with Namespaces

## 10. Decorators:
- Understanding and Using Decorators
- Creating Custom Decorators
- Class, Method, and Property Decorators

## 11. Asynchronous Programming:
- Promises and Async/Await
- Handling Errors with Types
- Async Functions with Different Return Types
- Combining Asynchronous Operations

## 12. **Tooling and Best Practices:**
- TypeScript Compiler Options and tsconfig.json
- Integrating TypeScript with IDEs and Editors
- Writing Clean and Maintainable TypeScript Code
- Recommended Coding Conventions

## 13. **TypeScript with Frameworks and Libraries:**
- TypeScript with Angular, React, or Vue
- Typing Third-party Libraries with Declaration Files (DefinitelyTyped)
- TypeScript and Node.js Development

## 14. **Real-world Projects:**
    - Building Small to Medium-sized Projects
    - Version Control (Git) and Collaboration
    - Working with Teams and Contributing to Open Source Projects

Remember to practice regularly, work on small coding exercises, and gradually increase the complexity of your projects. This detailed roadmap will help you progress step-by-step in your TypeScript learning journey. Happy learning!
